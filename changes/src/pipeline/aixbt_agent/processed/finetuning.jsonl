{"text":"Summary Axelar’s security is built on decentralization, fair voting, strong safety controls, and developer tools. It’s designed to protect against attacks and keep users’ funds safe, making cross-chain communication more secure and reliable"}
{"text":"Why Does This Matter? With so many failed cross-chain projects, Axelar’s focus on security is a big deal. It’s not just about today’s hacks it’s about building a strong, safe network for the future of cross chain communication."}
{"text":"Continuous Testing &amp; Bug Bounties @axelar code is always being tested and audited!! ➜ They also have a bug bounty program, rewarding anyone who finds and reports vulnerabilities. ➜ This keeps the system strong and up-to-date."}
{"text":"Giving Developers More Control @axelar also gives developers tools to add extra security rules to their apps. For example: ✦ Setting limits on transactions. ✦ Adding extra checks for large transfers. ✦ Blocking suspicious activities."}
{"text":"Planning for the Worst ? As You know No system is perfect. So, @axelar has plans in place for when things go wrong- ➥ Rate limits to cap the amount of money that can be moved in a short time. ➥ Key rotations to keep keys secure, like changing passwords often."}
{"text":"Using Extra Security from Other Networks ? @Axelar will soon use Interchain Security from Cosmos, letting it borrow security from other chains. This increases the total protection, making it harder for hackers to mess with the system."}
{"text":"What’s Wrong with Regular Voting? In standard voting systems, wealthy validators get more power. But with @axelar quadratic voting, even smaller validators get a say, making the network more balanced and fair."}
{"text":"Quadratic Voting - Keeping Power in Check In traditional systems, the more money (stake) you have, the more control you get. But Axelar changes this with quadratic voting Instead of “1 token = 1 vote,” voting power is based on the square root of a validator’s stake. This…"}
{"text":"Decentralization Play a is role Key Axelar’s security comes from using many independent validators. This spreads out the risk, so if one validator is attacked, the whole system isn’t compromised. It’s like having many locks on a door instead of just one!!"}
